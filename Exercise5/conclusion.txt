We used as input for our evaluation two datasets:

- A list of the most common typos in german, 89 in total, from the german Wikipedia.
- A list of similar but different words in german, 60 in total, downloaded from madoo.net for linguist purposes.


We compared our string similarity algorithms and get the following results:

Only levenshtein:

Presision:0,7747747748
Recall:0,9662921348


Levenshtein on soundex:

Precision:0,6086956522
Recall:0,9438202247


So, we come to the conclusion, that using levenshtein only yields better results than using levenshtein on the soundex values of the strings.
