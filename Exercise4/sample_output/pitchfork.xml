			<article>Photo byKirstie Shanley Titus Andronicus: In My Place (Coldplay Cover) (via SoundCloud)Titus Andronicus frontman and prolific Tweeter Patrick Sticklesposted two "#RARE" covers on Twitter last night: Bruce Springsteen's "Glory Days", which you can stream here,and Coldplay's"In My Place".The "Glory Days" cover is credited to "Shea Stadium All Stars". The song was recorded on November 29 at the band's practice space, the Brooklyn DIY venue Shea Stadium.It features members of the So So Glos on bass and backup vocals.At least 18 Tweets accompanied these covers. Here's an excerpt of Stickles' commentary:'Glory Days' is an essential song because it speaks about a very real phenomenon - u know people be sitting around talking about the past. We played it b/c we always sit around talking about the 'glory days' of the late-mid-00's DIY scene, and our 2009 'Bring on the Dudes' tour. As 4 this Coldplay cover, all I'll say is, when Eric  I switch instruments and sing harmonies, I'm reminded that we r true brothers. #loveEarlier, he said:I have another awesome cover from our rehearsal tapes... but I will not release it, because I don't want to read about 'Stickles' hilarious, intentionally tone deaf performance.' It's never intentionally tone deaf! Unintentional!Along with the covers, Stickles posted a few words regarding the band's third record, which will follow 2010's BNM'd The Monitor: "#NP new Titus demos - they sound pretty good, but not good enough!! #everydayimhustling." Headded, "if you don't read every tweet, you are not going to understand what I am saying on #LP3. You'll be totally lost."</article>

			<article>Rap Radar points to video from Friday night's episode of "Late Night With Jimmy Fallon", during whichBeyonc performed "Countdown" with help from the Roots. Anyone hoping for a visual progress report on the baby bump, though, will be disappointed to learn that the clip was taped months ago (perhaps back in July when she performed "Best Thing I Never Had" on the show.)During the same episode, Coldplay's Chris Martin stopped by for an interview during which Jimmy Fallon somehow convinced him to get on the floor and do the Worm (!) for the audience. It's perhaps one of the only things that could rival the charm of a Beyonc performance. Watch both clips, below.Beyonc: "Countdown":Chris Martin and Jimmy Fallon do the worm:</article>

Introducing Chris Martin on last night's episode of "The Colbert Report", he explained: "My guest tonight is lead singer for the Grammy-magnet rockers Coldplay, whose new album is called Mylo Xyloto, which I believe is Greek for 'Miley Cyrus.'"Zing!Also, when discussing whether or not Coldplay are influenced by Radiohead, Martin said,"We are not as good musically, but much more attractive," which Colbert agreed with.The band performed"Paradise" for television broadcast, and "Up in Flames" as a web exclusive. Both tracks will appear on the new album, which is out on October 24 via Capitol.Watch videos of the performances, along with Colbert's interview with Martin, below."Paradise":"Up in Flames":Colbert's interview with Martin:</article>

It's a fairly straightforward performance clip, with time-lapsed footage of the band rocking out in a decrepit area as the lyrics and other animated designs come alive in chalk-like form around them. Man, is it just me, or is Coldplay's new look pretty n-ravey these days? Check it out here.</article>

(Hopkins and Abrahams both contributed to Eno's new album Small Craft on a Milk Sea.) Now, all seven videos are up; check them all out at Eno's website. Watch Eno intently hunched over a table of electronic doohickeys while gorgeous waves of sound roll out.In other Eno news, he's been working with Coldplay lately, producing the follow-up to their last album, Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends, which Eno also produced. According to Billboard, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin told BBC News that the LP, which is still some time away from completion, is a concept album: "It's from the point of view of two people who are a bit lost, two like-minded outsiders who meet in a very difficult environment and therefore have a journey together."</article>

			<article>Photo by Francis ChungUPDATE: The Mew live album has been cancelled, according to Columbia.Outrageous Danish prog rockers Mew impressed Trent Reznor enough for the Nine Inch Nails frontman to invite them out on tour earlier this year. And one of their opening sets will be immortalized on the upcoming live album Live from the Hollywood Palladium, which is due out digitally this Monday, December 7, via Columbia. The tracklist is below. Mew are currently on the road in North America.In other Mew news, lead singer/guitarist Jonas Bjerre has teamed up with Coldplay bassist Guy Berryman and a-ha guitarist/keyboardist Magne Furuholmen for a new band called Apparatjik. The group has an amazingly annoying website and the video for their debut single "Electric Eye" is embedded below. The song sounds like 1985's version of the future.Mew live LP tracklist and Apparatjik video below:Live From the Hollywood Palladium: 01 Intro 02 The Circuitry of the Wolf 03 Chinaberry Tree 04 Am I Wry?

			<article>This January will mark the 20th anniversary of "The Simpsons". If Bart aged like normal people age, he'd be 30 now. For some reason, this news makes me incredibly upset.But at least the show has lined up a pretty big guest for its big 20th anniversary episode. As Coldplay's website reports, the band will appear on the show's big anniversary episode, airing January 14, 2010. It'll be fun to see what the animators do with Chris Martin's perpetual cowlick.Coldplay also have some other big plans for 2010. They'll spend February and March touring stadiums in Latin America, with the great Bat for Lashes opening. Those dates are below.Coldplay:02-26 Buenos Aires, Argentina - River Plate Stadium *02-28 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - Apoteose Stadium *03-02 Sao Paulo, Brazil - Morumbi Stadium *03-04 Bogota, Colombia - Parque Simon Bolivar *03-06 Mexico City, Mexico - Foro Sol *03-09 Guadalajara, Mexico - Estadio Tres de Marzo *03-11 Monterrey, Mexico - Estadio Universitario ** with Bat for Lashes</article>

			<article>It's easy to make fun of Coldplay, but not when they do something like this. NME reports that the Brit-rock giants have donated one million pounds to Kids Company, a London-based charity whose stated aim is "to provide practical, emotional and educational support to vulnerable inner-city children and young people." According to NME, the band's members have also visited Kids Company centers, and they plan to give music lessons to the kids there. They're putting their mouths where their money is.Kids Company founder Camila Batmanghelidjh told NME, "They were moved by the tough stories they heard and want to be genuine participants ... I got the feeling the donation was something they had planned from the start of their careers."Keep in mind, Americans, that this total amounts to $1,616,809 U.S. dollars.

			<headline>Coldplay Settle Joe Satriani Lawsuit</headline>
			<newsdate>September 15, 2009 at 05:30 p.m.</newsdate>
			<link>http://pitchfork.com/news/36493-coldplay-settle-joe-satriani-lawsuit/</link>
			<article>Last December, perennial Guitar Player cover subject Joe Satriani sued Coldplay, claiming that the British band ripped off significant portions of his song "If I Could Fly" in their world-conquering mega-hit "Viva La Vida". Coldplay denied the claim, repeatedly insisting in statements and interviews that the song was theirs and theirs alone.Unfortunately, we're never going to get to see the sublime spectacle of Satriani and Chris Martin screaming at each other in a courtroom. TwentyFourBit points to this Justia News report, and Billboard confirms, that Coldplay have settled the lawsuit.In the Justia News report, Judge Dean D. Pregerson dismisses the lawsuit "under Stipulation". We might never learn what this particular "Stipulation" means; it could be that Chris Martin has to mow Satriani's lawn for a month. But if these two parties have come to some agreement, odds are that it hinges on an undisclosed sum of money changing hands. Indeed, Billboard reports that according to "legal sources", both parties have come to a "financial settlement" and that "Coldplay will not be required to admit any wrongdoing."In any case, the great Coldplay/Satriani saga is now over. Now Coldplay have to decide whether they'll take Cat Stevens up on his settlement offer: a cup of tea.</article>

			<article>Roughly 95 percent of all iPhone apps are wildly useless. (Did you know that there's one called "Are You a Lazy Bum?" that tells you how lazy you are based on a quiz? A tip: If you're taking an iPhone quiz about how lazy you are, you are one lethargic motherfucker.)But there are a few that can make a train ride or a cousin's birthday party or a shitty opening band set go by a bit quicker. In this recurring feature, we'll round up new music-related apps-- for bands, labels, etc.-- and try to give you the skinny on whether they're worth your time and/or money.Click on for reviews of recent apps from Jason Forrest, Coldplay, Ghostly International, Depeche Mode, and the Raveonettes:Jason Forrest's Star6 ($6.99)Genre-busting sampling freak Jason Forrest presents this sampling program that allows you to manipulate loops and sounds. Adjust speed, pitch, delay, distortion, jitter and more-- with ease. The program comes with a bunch of fuckwithable audio files, but you can also upload your own and record the results.Roughly how much time could I potentially waste using this app in a single day? 30 minutes.Will I look silly tapping at this app while using public transportation?Probably, but it's worth it.Star6 demo video:Coldplay "Strawberry Swing" (free)Watch Coldplay's eye-blowing new chalk-animated video for "Strawberry Swing", directed by famed innovators Shynola, whenever you want. Also play three different games where you control Chris Martin's superhero character as he flys, swims, and tries to avoid skeleton-headed enemies (screenshot pictured above). Features links to the band's other videos-- handy for that 3 a.m. "Yellow" fix (I may have said too much).Roughly how much time could I potentially waste using this app in a single day?15 minutes.Will I look silly tapping at this app while using public transportation?Oh yeah.Ghostly Discovery (free)Electro-leaning label Ghostly International's program allows you to listen to full streaming songs from their catalogue, according to your mood. It's a generous promotional tool disguised as a mood ring, but it's quite a brilliant disguise. Very slick and friendly design, too.Roughly how much time could I potentially waste using this app in a single day? 30 minutes.Will I look silly tapping at this app while using public transportation?Not a chance.Ghostly Discovery demo video:Depeche Mode Sounds of the Universe (free)Remember that ugly, seemingly Pick-Up Sticks-inspired cover of Depeche Mode's new album? This app shows the cover, and if you touch one of the colored sticks it sets off a different loop from Sounds of the Universe. Basically a DM remix tool for toddlers.Roughly how much time could I potentially waste using this app in a single day?One minute.Will I look silly tapping at this app while using public transportation? Absolutely.The Raveonettes (free)Gauzy Velvet Underground disciples the Raveonettes serve up what's quickly becoming a cookie-cutter band app formula: videos, songs, link to Twitter account, useless message board, etc.Roughly how much time could I potentially waste using this app in a single day? One minute.Will I look silly tapping at this app while using public transportation? No-- this thing could stand to be a bit sillier.</article>

			<article>All photos by Ryan Dombal. Above: Yeah Yeah Yeah YeahsIn a New York Times piece last week titled "Fighting the Ghost of Festivals Past", Goldenvoice president Paul Tollett, mouthpiece for the second annual All Points West Festival said, "It should be smoother this year. And a lot more fun." Talk about jinxing yourself.Granted, this year's APW-- held in Jersey City, New Jersey's Liberty State Park, just south of Manhattan-- was an upgrade from last year in several ways. The ferries carting people to and from NYC were bountiful and organized, the lineup was more diverse and consistent (including last-minute sub Jay-Z, who filled in for the ailing Beastie Boys), the JumboTrons were even jumbo-er. But there's nothing like a little rain to turn millions of dollars of planning into a sewage-smelling, sneaker-ruining swamp. Festival-certified acts including Jay-Z and Coldplay earned their keep at this year's APW, but they couldn't help but be partially upstaged by water that fell from the sky.Truth be told, there were only a few hours of downpour across the fest's three days. But Friday afternoon's heavy precipitation, along with a constant stream of foot traffic, was enough to make the rest of the weekend irreparably soggy. While there's no real upside to slogging through shoe-sticking mud for a couple days, the first-world calamity did give the thousands who showed up a sense of unity and pride against the elements. It also offered the opportunity to judge artists on a harsh-but-fair rubric: Can you make me forget I'm standing in crud alongside lots of dirty people without any clear means of escape?Some artists turned the less-than-ideal circumstances into an afterthought. Others didn't. Check out the breakdown-- with photos and YouTube videos-- after the jump:The following bands rendered the mud, the rain, and the grossness moot. I speak for many who still can't get that odd stench off them when I say: Thank you. Listed in order of excellence:Jay-Z: "No Sleep Till Brooklyn"Coldplay:"Fight for Your Right to Party""Yellow"Yeah Yeah Yeahs:"Zero""Maps"My Bloody Valentine:"Only Shallow"Lykke Li:"Dance, Dance, Dance"Vampire Weekend:"Walcott"Tokyo Police Club:"Your English Is Good"The following bands did their best to beat the weather, but couldn't quite pull it off. Maybe next year, guys!The National:St. Vincent:Fleet Foxes:Arctic Monkeys:Neko Case:Chairlift:Ra Ra Riot:Organized Konfusion:The Cool Kids:Kool Keith:La Roux:Tool:</article>

			<article>Say what you will about Coldplay, but they have good taste in opening acts. Coldplay have just announced the lineup of artists they'll be playing with on their European stadium tour, which kicks off in mid-August in Denmark, and it's a pretty great list.The lineup changes from date to date, but there aren't too many shows without at least one amazing opener. The Flaming Lips and Bat for Lashes are both on board for a few dates; in Paris and Nijmegen, Netherlands, they're both on the bill together. The great British club-pop crew Girls Aloud will tag along for a few dates, and White Lies, Howling Bells, and Datarock also offer support. And, as previously reported, some guy named Jay-Z also shares the bill. All that, and you totally get to sing along with "Yellow" at the top of your lungs. Sounds like a pretty good night out.

			<headline>Cat Stevens Says He Forgives Coldplay for Stealing "Viva La Vida" Melody</headline>

			<link>http://pitchfork.com/news/35624-cat-stevens-says-he-forgives-coldplay-for-stealing-viva-la-vida-melody/</link>
			<article>Last month, we reported that Yusuf Islam, the man formerly known as Cat Stevens, had joined the list of folks claiming that Coldplay ripped him off for their hit "Viva La Vida".Islam told the British tabloid The Sun that Coldplay had plagiarized pieces of his 1973 song "Foreigner Suite".But Islam's a nice enough guy that he didn't want to sue Coldplay over the dispute. According to the British rag The Daily Express, he even forgives Coldplay. (via TwentyFourBit)He said, "I stand by what I said. They did copy my song but I don't think they did it on purpose. I have even copied myself without even knowing I have done it. I'll write down what I think is a good melody and realise it's the same as something I have already done. I don't want them to think I am angry with them. I'd love to sit down and have a cup of tea with them and let them know it's okay." Fellow alleged Coldplay burglary victim Joe Satriani, meanwhile, has yet to offer Coldplay an invitation for tea; his lawsuit against the band continues. And Coldplay continue to insist that they wrote the song themselves.</article>

			<link>http://pitchfork.com/news/35241-cat-stevens-says-coldplay-stole-his-song/</link>
			<article>As Coldplay do battle with Joe Satriani in court after the guitar hero claimed the Britpop superstars stole his 2004 song "If I Could Fly" for their smash "Viva La Vida", Cat Stevens (who currently goes by the name Yusuf Islam) is looking to get in on the action. According to UK rag The Sun (via NME), Stevens is now claiming Chris Martin and company actually stole "Viva La Vida" from his 1973 song "Foreigner Suite". (Apparently, the bit in question can be found here, at the 5:15 mark-- seems like a stretch but judge for yourself.) I'm not sure where this leaves Joe Satriani, but the good news is Stevens is not looking to sue Coldplay.Perhaps Stevens knows the similarities aren't that strong. Or maybe he's hoping to settle and split royalties with Coldplay, just like he did with the Flaming Lips when it was pointed out that their song "Fight Test" sounded an awful lot like Stevens' own "Father and Son". Either way, the news gives hacky editors the green light for even more "Copy Cat!" headlines.</article>

			<article>In the past few years, American music festivals have stepped their game up in a very big way. Ten years ago, the only things happening were alt-rock radio-station shows and Tibetan Freedom Concerts. These days, we've got Coachella and Bonnaroo and Lollapalooza: European-style multi-day fests with big-name headliners and huge crowds.Nothing on this side of the Atlantic, however, can really compete with Denmark's annual Roskilde Festival. Last year, the show managed to find room for Radiohead and Jay-Z and Neil Young and Judas Priest and My Bloody Valentine. And this year's festival looks to be just as insane. The show, which goes down July 2-5, will feature Coldplay, Kanye West, Oasis, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Nine Inch Nails, Lil Wayne, Fleet Foxes, Nick Cave  the Bad Seeds, Pet Shop Boys, Grace Jones, Fucked Up, Major Lazer, Fever Ray, Ida Maria, Gang Gang Dance, M. Ward, Amadou  Mariam, and about a million others.Seriously, how is anyone over here supposed to compete with that? This is the kind of lineup that makes unemployed recession-stricken Americans check plane ticket prices just to make sure they can't afford the trip. Freak out accordingly.The full lineup is here.</article>

			<headline>Coldplay Deny Joe Satriani in Court</headline>
			<newsdate>April 7, 2009 at 04:00 p.m.</newsdate>
			<link>http://pitchfork.com/news/35021-coldplay-deny-joe-satriani-in-court/</link>
			<article>Last year, we reported that noted axe-wrecker and Guitar World mainstay Joe Satriani had filed suit against Coldplay, claiming that Coldplay's "Viva La Vida" contains "substantial original portions" of Satriani's own song "If I Could Fly". And while it's a bit of a stretch to imagine that the Surfing With the Alien guy could be in any way responsible for one of last year's most world-wrecking rock singles, the two songs do share remarkably similar melodies, as plenty of YouTube videos have been happy to point out. (The part about seeing the fear in your enemy's eyes was definitely all Coldplay, though.)Not long after Satriani filed suit, Coldplay released a statement claiming that Satriani didn't have anything to do with "Viva La Vida": "Joe Satriani is a great musician, but he did not write the song 'Viva la Vida'. We respectfully ask him to accept our assurances of this and wish him well with all future endeavors." Satriani did not accept those assurances, of course. I mean, would you? The Associated Press (via Billboard) reports that lawyers for Coldplay have once again insisted that Satriani didn't write the song, this time in court. Yesterday, they filed a response in a Los Angeles federal court, claiming that "If I Could Fly" "lacks originality" and doesn't warrant copyright protection. According to Billboard, Satriani's lawyer believed the matter could've been resolved out of court, which is usually where cases like this end. Coldplay are sticking to their guns, though, and they stand to lose all kinds of money if the court rules against them. In the meantime, the members of Coldplay don't appear to be losing any sleep. They've been busy recording their Viva La Vida follow-up with producer Brian Eno, and they've booked a mammoth summer tour.</article>

			<article>Between Trent Reznor's "new Timbaland-produced album" (still waiting on Chris Cornell's Twitter response) and Peter Bjorn and John's StSanders video, this has been a banner day for all sorts of fools. Here's a quick rundown of the pranks, tricks, and kinda-real-sounding rumors we came across over the last eight hours:Who: Sufjan StevensThe "big news": A fan site claims to reveal Sufjan's next state: Delaware (or, rather, Dela-where?-- with tracklist)!Believability: More believable than anyone wants to admit.Would it be cool if this was real? We wish Sufjan would write a song called "We Tried to Shrink But We're Only Second Best".Who: ColdplayThe "big news": Coldplay and producer Brian Eno plan to record in zero gravity on a specially-designed Boeing 727.Believability: You mean those "Viva La Vida" strings were recorded in regular gravity?Would it be cool if this was real? Yes, if only to see guitarist Jonny Buckland's hat fly off his head to reveal a very tiny version of the Edge's head.Who: BjrkThe "big news": The wild-voiced legend is set to replace wild-voiced legend Robert Plant as Led Zeppelin's new singer.Believability: Zero, though she would definitely be more welcomed than that dude from Alter Bridge.Would it be cool if this was real? Probably not.Who: Sigur RsThe "big news": The Icelandic group's front man, Jnsi, is in the studio working on a duet with Coldplay's Chris Martin.Believability: Considering both singers' distinct eunuch-like delivery, this seems pretty believable.Would it be cool if this was real? Yes. This should've happened already.Who: Kid RockThe "big news": The good ol' boy renames Detroit's Comerica Park, home of the Tigers, to Kid Rock Field.Believability: In this era of bailouts and bank failures, why not?Would it be cool if this was real? Kid Rock Field really does nail some kind of goofy-cool sweet spot.Who: Tapes 'n TapesThe "big news": The guys recorded a jazz-metal fusion album called The Iron Tunnel to Jupiter.Believability: Considering that they didn't exactly show much range on their second album, this seems unlikely.Would it be cool if this was real? Not at all.</article>

But, in the end, the same voters who always seem to go for what's old, respected, and safe triumphed by awarding Robert Plant and Alison Krauss' (admittedly not bad) duets project both Record of the Year and Album of the Year along with three other trophies, making them the night's biggest winners. Behind them was Wayne with four wins including Best Rap Album and Best Rap Song for "Lollipop". Coldplay took three golden gramophones home, including Song of the Year for "Viva La Vida" and Best Rock Album.Other Pitchfork-friendly acts who accumulated some hardware last night: Radiohead won for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package for In Rainbows -- and anyone who owns the hardcover double-vinyl Rainbows set knows the award was well-deserved. (Though Trent Reznor, whose Ghosts set was up for the same award, disagreed .) Daft Punk were also two-time winners, taking Best Dance/Electronic Album for their live record Alive 2007 , and Best Dance Recording for "Harder Better Faster Stronger" off the same album. (All that Kanye love couldn't have hurt).Speaking of Mr. West, the sometime Grammy brat was involved in two award-winning tracks-- Estelle's "American Boy" (Best Rap/Sung Collaboration) and his collaboration with Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, and T.I., "Swagga Like Us" (Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group). Justice nabbed Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical for their reworking of MGMT's "Electric Feel", Weezer took Best Short Form Music Video for their viral-ready "Pork and Beans" clip, Bruce Springsteen made the Best Rock Song-- "Girls in Their Summer Clothes"-- according to the Recording Academy, and They Might Be Giants beat out all others to win Best Musical Album for Children.Check out a list of all the nominations and winners here .M.I.A. may have lost her Record of the Year bid, but the very pregnant pop rebel (she's due any minute now) did take part in the night's undoubted highlight, a black-tie take on "Swagga Like Us" along with Kanye, Wayne, Jay, and T.I. And it's not like she tried to hide her bump, either-- her polka-dot bikini/mesh outfit left little to the imagination. It was easily the most fearless performance of the entire night.A few Pitchfork staffers kept tabs on the proceedings via the Pitchfork Twitter , while ?uestlove 's and Diplo 's takes from inside the belly of the beast are essential reading.There were other highlights, too. Ladies and gentlemen, your Grammy Superlatives: Best Pete Wentz Tribute : Bono and his guyliner Best Smile : The Rock Best Tinsel-Based Shoulder Adornment : Chris Martin Most Likely to Be High on Three Too Many Painkillers : Whitney Houston (runner-up: Travis Barker)  Best Neil Diamond Impersonator : Neil Diamond Best Mick Jagger-With-An-Itch Impression (Or Muppet impression ): Thom Yorke  Best Nomination Cutaway : Faux-water-breaking M.I.A.  Most Likely to Be a Cyborg Who's Hiding Crucial Machinery Under His Hat : Kenny ChesneyMost Likely to Be a "Close Talker" : Kevin Jonas  Most Likely to Be Watching the Grammys from Home in Two Years (Please?) : Miley Cyrus  Best So-Called Bling : Joe JonasMost Likely to Be Checking Wikipedia to See If He Is Indeed Still Alive : Ringo Starr  Most Likely to Be Long-Lost Brothers : T-Pain and will.i.am  Best Guitar Solo : Carrie Underwood's badass blonde bombshell axe slinger (apologies to B.B.

			<headline>Coldplay Reveal North American Summer Tour</headline>

			<link>http://pitchfork.com/news/34560-coldplay-reveal-north-american-summer-tour/</link>
			<article>People love to get mad talking about Coldplay, but when you see them doing the soaring anthemic Brit-rock thing in an actual arena surrounded by blinding columns of light, you have to hand it to them: They know exactly what they're doing. This is, after all, a band with a history of releasing gigantic yellow beach balls into the crowd right when the opening notes of "Yellow" hits. There is no getting mad at that. It's simply not possible.So it's good to see that they're going on another full-scale North American outdoor-shed tour this summer. Worth noting: There seems to be a Lollapalooza-sized hole somewhere in that schedule, and Lolla is going to have to pull out something big to compete with all these other summer festivals.Coldplay have also announced the opening acts for the tour. The British retro-jazzbo sibling group Kitty, Daisy  Lewis, who kind of sound like Squirrel Nut Zippers, will open the whole tour. Fellow Brit-rock mopers Elbow are also on the bill for half the tour, as are (this is awesome) blind Malian guitar heroes Amadou  Mariam.And who knows? Coldplay is hard at work with producer Brian Eno yet again, so they may have a few more rafter-shaking jams ready for us by the time they hit these shores. Coldplay will also be among the huge roster of performers at this Sunday's Grammy Awards, and for some reason there will also be a "60 Minutes" segment on the band right before the awards show. Because, you know, there's nothing else important happening in the world.Coldplay dates:02-11 Tokyo, Japan - Saitama Super Arena ^02-12 Tokyo, Japan - Saitama Super Arena ^02-14 Osaka, Japan - Kobe World Kinen Hall ^02-15 Osaka, Japan - Kobe World Kinen Hall ^02-18 London, England - Shepherds Bush Empire (War Child benefit) 02-27 Perth, Australia - Burswood Dome02-28 Perth, Australia - Burswood Dome03-03 Melbourne, Australia - Rod Laver Arena03-04 Melbourne, Australia - Rod Laver Arena03-05 Melbourne, Australia - Rod Laver Arena03-08 Brisbane, Australia - Entertainment Centre03-09 Brisbane, Australia - Entertainment Centre03-11 Sydney, Australia - Acer Arena03-12 Sydney, Australia - Acer Arena03-14 Sydney, Australia - Acer Arena03-15 Sydney, Australia - Acer Arena03-18 Auckland, New Zealand - Vector Arena03-19 Auckland, New Zealand - Vector Arena07-02 Arras, France - Main Square Festival07-03 Werchter, Belgium - Rock Werchter07-05 Roskilde, Denmark - Roskilde Festival07-10 Portland, OR - The Amphitheater at Clark County !@ 07-11 George, WA - The Gorge Amphitheatre !@ 07-13 San Francisco, CA - Shoreline Amphitheatre !@ 07-16 San Diego, CA - Cricket Wireless Amphitheatre !@ 07-18 Carson, CA - Home Depot Center !@ 07-21 Dallas, TX - Superpages.com Center !@ 07-22 Houston, TX - Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion !@ 07-24 Maryland Heights, MO - Verizon Wireless Amphitheater !@ 07-25 East Troy, WI - Alpine Valley Music Theatre !% 07-29 Toronto, Ontario - TBD !% 08-03 Mansfield, MA - Comcast Center !% 08-06 Raleigh, NC - Time Warner Cable Music Pavilion !% 08-07 Charlotte, NC - Charlotte Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre !% 08-09 Tampa, FL - Ford Amphitheatre !%08-16 Herning, Denmark - MCH Arena08-19 Bergen, Norway - Koengen08-22 Stockholm, Sweden - Olympic Stadium08-25 Hanover, Germany - Hanover Stadium08-27 Dsseldorf, Germany - LTU Arena08-29 Munich, Germany - Reitstadion Riem08-31 Udine, Italy - Stadio Friuli09-02 Bern, Switzerland - Stade de Suisse09-04 Barcelona, Spain - Estadi Olimpic09-07 Paris, France - Parc des Princes09-09 Nijmegen, Holland - Goffertpark09-10 Nijmegen, Netherlands - Goffertpark09-12 Manchester, England - LCCC *09-14 Dublin, Ireland - Phoenix Park09-16 Glasgow, Scotland - Hampden Park *09-18 London, England - Wembley Stadium #09-19 London, England - Wembley Stadium *^ with Santogold with the Killers! with Kitty, Daisy  Lewis@ with Amadou  Mariam% with Elbow* with Jay-Z# with Girls Aloud</article>

			<headline>Coldplay Kick Chris Martin Out...</headline>
			<newsdate>February 4, 2009 at 02:30 p.m.</newsdate>
			<link>http://pitchfork.com/news/34541-coldplay-kick-chris-martin-out/</link>
			<article>Photo by Kathryn YuAdmit it: Viva la Vida, Coldplay's first trip into the Eno-verse, has held up pretty well. These guys are some of the last honest-to-God stars on the face of the Earth, and they would've been just fine if they'd just kept biting "Clocks" over and over. They didn't have to head into the studio with a legendary genius producer who pushed them to tinker with their epicness in all sorts of unexpected ways, but they did it, and it worked out. When that chorus kicks in on "Lost!", forget about it. Game over. (Also, because of Viva La Vida, this happened.)Last month, we reported that Coldplay were striking while the adult-contempo arena-alt was hot and hitting the studio with Brian Eno once again. And thanks to a post on Coldplay's website, we now have some insight into what, exactly, these guys all do in the booth. The post is credited to the mysterious "Roadie #42", and according to this guy, Eno's not done monkeying with Coldplay's formula.Apparently, the band usually builds on frontman Chris Martin's demo recordings. But Eno's trying something else out: Banning Martin from the studio, keeping just his vocal track in most cases, and letting the other three dudes build the rest of the songs themselves. The other dudes, understandably, are amped.Reports Roadie #42: "Often, they come in first thing in the morning and listen to Chris's idea once, before going out into the live room and working up something based purely on how the song 'felt' to them on first listen, paying little heed to what chords he chose or how the melody sat." Chris Martin better watch out because pretty soon these guys might start demanding their own close-ups in the videos. Martin, meanwhile, isn't using his time off to think up even more ridiculous baby-names with Gwyneth Paltrow. According to that post, "he's up the road at another studio pouring out songs in a writing project with another artist." Roadie #42 doesn't say who the other artist is, but it's probably a rapper.</article>

			<headline>News in Brief: The Killers, Coldplay, Ladyfinger, Takka Takka, Venice Is Sinking</headline>
			<newsdate>January 30, 2009 at 11:15 a.m.</newsdate>
			<link>http://pitchfork.com/news/34369-news-in-brief-the-killers-coldplay-ladyfinger-takka-takka-venice-is-sinking/</link>
			<article>-- The Killers and Coldplay will play a benefit concert together in front of 2,000 people at London's Shepherd's Bush Empire on February 18. These are bands that can regularly draw crowds ten times that size on their own; this is a special show. The two world-conquering entities are getting together in the name of humanitarian organization War Child's 15th anniversary. As previously reported, the charity will also release the star-studded Heroes CD (with the likes of TV on the Radio, Beck, Hot Chip, and Lily Allen covering classic tracks) in the UK February 16 on Parlophone and February 24 in the U.S. on Astralwerks.-- B-list Saddle Creek band Ladyfinger (ne) will vie for the A-list with their new album, dusk, which comes out February 3. When it comes to album titles, all-lowercase is the new dot com. The band will hit the road in February and March.-- Vaugely otherworldly indie rockers Takka Takka are taking to the road in support of their new album, Migration. Their tour route may or may not follow the same exact migration pattern as the Northern Pintail. The first stop is a release party for the Guilt by Association 2 covers compilation, also featuring Robbers on High Street, Jukebox the Ghost, and Lowry. Along for the ride for most of the trek is Sister Suvi, featuring Patrick Gregoire of Islands.-- Venice Is Sinking is a band and a concept and a city in a concept that's falling below water. They're from Athens, Georgia and they're putting out a new album on March 31 via One Percent Press. It's called AZAR, which refers to an "effective math teacher who is usually an ex-marine" according to Urban Dictionary. First single is called "Ryan's Song". (Full disclosure: I'm pretty sure it's about my addiction to Jamba Juice.)</article>

			<headline>Coldplay Head Back to the Studio With Noted Bald Man</headline>
			<newsdate>January 23, 2009 at 12:20 p.m.</newsdate>
			<link>http://pitchfork.com/news/34457-coldplay-head-back-to-the-studio-with-noted-bald-man/</link>
			<article>When it was first announced that Brian Eno was working with Coldplay back in 2007, some people overreacted, pissed their egghead idol was lowering himself to Chris Martin  Co.'s level. But now, a couple years later and with Viva la Vida and The Prospekt's March EP proving to be solid additions to the sweeping arena rock canon, both entities have prospered from the collaboration. Coldplay are not as terribly uncool as before; Eno can afford that new bathroom (and still make albums with David Byrne).So news that the two are heading back to the studio for a couple weeks (via-- where else?-- Twitter) before Coldplay head out to Tokyo next month is decidedly less controversial than it once was.The band are playing immense stadiums around the world much of this year, so the possibility of a new release seems slim. Then again, they seem to be in some sort of pleasantly-rocking zone right now, so we'll see. The band is likely to win at least a couple awards at this year's Grammys (airing Febuary 8)-- they did one of those song-collage Grammy ads, too.While we hope Eno worked some magic on U2's new album, the uber-producer is keeping busy by denouncing Israel and stuff.</article>

			<headline>Thom Yorke: Grammy Spokesman Extraordinaire</headline>
			<newsdate>January 13, 2009 at 04:55 p.m.</newsdate>
			<link>http://pitchfork.com/news/34359-thom-yorke-grammy-spokesman-extraordinaire/</link>
			<article>After a long, dark slumber, the Grammys may be waking up. The tiny gramophone awards have suffered a steady decline in interest (last year's broadcast was second to only 2006's all-time ratings low), but this year's surprisingly aware nominees -- Lil Wayne, M.I.A., Radiohead, Kanye, T.I.-- and an admittedly eye-catching ad campaign are poised to prevent more dismal numbers for the February 8 telecast. So maybe this year will only be the third-lowest ever. Fingers crossed.Back to those ads. When I saw Thom Yorke's face hovering above some subway stairs near Central Park last weekend, I was struck-- why would our global hero lend his likeness to something as patently lame as the Grammys? Well, there's a trade-off. Part of Grammy's "Celebrate the Music That Made Us" campaign, the ad is made up of the names of songs that have influenced Mr. Yorke over the years, including Bjrk's "Unravel" ( web-famously covered by Radiohead ), David Bowie ("Ashes to Ashes") and Liars (""The Wrong Coat for You Mt. Heart Attack"). Grammy gets to use Thom; Thom gets to promote Liars song names. An even trade! (Check out a larger version of the Thom Yorke ad here .)The same idea runs through the rest of the Grammy plugs, which feature Kanye West, Coldplay, Lil Wayne, Rihanna, Stevie Wonder, and, ugh, Lenny Kravitz. You guys were a Kravitz away from something pretty amazing! (If I had a nickel for every time I heard that one, etc.) TV ads narrated by these highly influenced artists will start running soon, too. (Via Idolator .)Check out the ads starring Coldplay, Kanye, and Lil Wayne below. (Hey look, Kanye likes "The Eraser"! Is that going to be weird now at the Grammys because Thom didn't put Kanye songs in his collage? Hmm.)

			<headline>Coldplay: Joe Satriani "Did Not Write 'Viva la Vida'"</headline>
			<newsdate>December 9, 2008 at 06:30 p.m.</newsdate>
			<link>http://pitchfork.com/news/34232-coldplay-joe-satriani-did-not-write-viva-la-vida/</link>
			<article>Say it ain't so, Joe: Coldplay have issued a response to a lawsuit filed against the band late last week by six-string scientist Joe Satriani, who claims the UK megastars ripped off his "If I Could Fly" for their "Viva la Vida". And what do you know, they're standing their ground.Quoth a statement on Coldplay's website [via Billboard.com], "With the greatest possible respect to Joe Satriani, we have now unfortunately found it necessary to respond publicly to his allegations. If there are any similarities between our two pieces of music, they are entirely coincidental, and just as surprising to us as to him."They continue, "Joe Satriani is a great musician, but he did not write the song 'Viva la Vida'. We respectfully ask him to accept our assurances of this and wish him well with all future endeavors." Well that's nice, dudes, what about the real victim in this whole mess: that one Brooklyn band?Billboard.com also points to a recent Musicradar.com interview with Joe Satriani, in which Joe the Guitarist waxes emo about the alleged act of plagiarism: "I felt like a dagger went right through my heart. It hurt so much."He also says some less corny things: "Everybody assumes I'm trying to go after these guys in Coldplay, as if I'm doing this with malice. That's the furthest thing from my mind. I'm just doing what I need to do as an artist, to protect what's mine, to protect those feelings I put down in song."I did everything I could to avoid a court case with this situation. But Coldplay didn't want to talk about it. They just wanted this whole thing to go away. Maybe they figured this little guitar player guy will leave them alone after a while, I don't know. But we're talking about a piece of art that I created, and that's something I feel is important. I think everybody should feel that way."Both plaintiff and defendant then took baths in enormous pools full of money.Regardless of the actions of any little guitar player guys, Coldplay are all set to tour the bejesus out of 2009.Coldplay:12-09 Glasgow, Scotland - SECC12-11 Manchester, England - MEN Arena12-12 Manchester, England - MEN Arena12-14 London, England - O2 Arena12-15 London, England - O2 Arena12-16 London, England - O2 Arena12-19 Belfast, Northern Ireland - Odyssey Arena12-21 Dublin, Ireland - The O212-22 Dublin, Ireland - The O212-23 Belfast, Northern Ireland - Odyssey Arena02-11 Tokyo, Japan - Saitama Super Arena ^02-12 Tokyo, Japan - Saitama Super Arena ^02-14 Osaka, Japan - Kobe World Kinen Hall ^02-15 Osaka, Japan - Kobe World Kinen Hall ^02-27 Perth, Australia - Burswood Dome02-28 Perth, Australia - Burswood Dome03-03 Melbourne, Australia - Rod Laver Arena03-04 Melbourne, Australia - Rod Laver Arena03-05 Melbourne, Australia - Rod Laver Arena03-08 Brisbane, Australia - Entertainment Centre03-09 Brisbane, Australia - Entertainment Centre03-11 Sydney, Australia - Acer Arena03-12 Sydney, Australia - Acer Arena03-14 Sydney, Australia - Acer Arena03-15 Sydney, Australia - Acer Arena08-16 Herning, Denmark - MCH Arena08-19 Bergen, Norway - Koengen08-22 Stockholm, Sweden - Olympic Stadium08-25 Hanover, Germany - Hanover Stadium08-27 Dsseldorf, Germany - LTU Arena08-29 Munich, Germany - Reitstadion Riem09-10 Nijmegen, Netherlands - Goffertpark09-12 Manchester, England - LCCC *09-14 Dublin, Ireland - Phoenix Park09-16 Glasgow, Scotland - Hampden Park *09-18 London, England - Wembley Stadium #09-19 London, England - Wembley Stadium *^ with Santogold* with Jay-Z# with Girls Aloud</article>

			<headline>Joe Satriani Sues Coldplay Over "Viva La Vida"</headline>
			<newsdate>December 5, 2008 at 10:55 a.m.</newsdate>
			<link>http://pitchfork.com/news/34192-joe-satriani-sues-coldplay-over-viva-la-vida/</link>
			<article>Man, seems like everybody wants a piece of Coldplay these days... or is it the other way around? The bombastic Brits were accused of ripping off Brooklyn's Creaky Boards back in June for their hit song "Viva la Vida", the almost-title-track from their recent smash LP Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends. Now, Coldplay have once again been accused of ripping somebody off... for the very same song.According to Reuters (via Billboard.com), virtuoso guitarist Joe Satriani filed a lawsuit Thursday in Los Angeles federal court claiming "Viva la Vida" contains "substantial original portions" of his 2004 instrumental tune "If I Could Fly". Satriani wants a jury trial, damages, and "any and all profits" from the song. Which would be a hell of a lot.A little research-- okay, YouTube-- coughs up a video that plays a snippet of his noodly "If I Could Fly" under the familiar verse melody from the Coldplay track, and, well... it's not dissimilar. You can also hear an excerpt of the song here.The lawsuit comes just a day after Coldplay were nominated for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocals Grammys for the very song in question, and three others besides. Convenient timing, huh, Satriani?Coldplay, whose hot-to-trot Kylie Minogue collaboration recently made its way to the 'net, are on the road right now.Coldplay:12-06 Glasgow, Scotland - SECC12-07 Liverpool, England - Echo Arena12-09 Glasgow, Scotland - SECC12-11 Manchester, England - MEN Arena12-12 Manchester, England - MEN Arena12-14 London, England - O2 Arena12-15 London, England - O2 Arena12-16 London, England - O2 Arena12-19 Belfast, Northern Ireland - Odyssey Arena12-21 Dublin, Ireland - The O212-22 Dublin, Ireland - The O212-23 Belfast, Northern Ireland - Odyssey Arena02-12 Tokyo, Japan - Saitama Super Arena02-14 Osaka, Japan - Kobe World Kinen Hall02-15 Osaka, Japan - Kobe World Kinen Hall02-27 Perth, Australia - Burswood Dome03-03 Melbourne, Australia - Rod Laver Arena03-04 Melbourne, Australia - Rod Laver03-08 Brisbane, Australia - Entertainment Centre03-09 Brisbane, Australia - Entertainment Centre03-11 Sydney, Australia - Acer Arena03-12 Sydney, Australia - Acer Arena09-12 Manchester, England - LCCC *09-16 Glasgow, Scotland - Hampden Park *09-19 London, England - Wembley Stadium ** with Jay-Z</article>

			<headline>Grammy Nominations Surprisingly Relevant</headline>
			<newsdate>December 3, 2008 at 11:55 p.m.</newsdate>
			<link>http://pitchfork.com/news/34178-grammy-nominations-surprisingly-relevant/</link>
			<article>Well, this was unexpected. Perhaps coming to terms with the fact that increasingly few people give a shit about the Grammys, the Recording Academy tonight announced its list of nominees for the 51st Annual Grammy Awards, and those nominees were...shockingly relevant. (Read the whole list HERE.) You know who got the most nominations? Lil Wayne! He's up for eight Grammys! That's right, not the Eagles or Bob Dylan or John Legend or U2 or some boring old fart your dad likes. Lil Wayne! Pretty risque move, Grammys. I like it. While it would be pretty awesome if the Grammy for Album of the Year went to an album with THIS FUCKING COVER, it probably isn't going to happen, as Weezy has some pretty stiff competition in that category: Coldplay's Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends (which will probably win) Ne-Yo's Year of the Gentleman (!), Robert Plant  Alison Krauss's Raising Sand (which will win if Coldplay doesn't), and-- hey why not?--Radiohead's In Rainbows. Yes, Lil Wayne and Radiohead are competing for Album of the Year. Please dear god, let those two pair up for one of those collaborative medley things that the Grammys always do. Please! But you know what's even crazier? M.I.A.'s "Paper Planes" is up for Record of the Year! It totally won't win (it's up against Coldplay, Robert Plant  Alison Krauss, Leona Lewis, and Adele), but can you imagine if it did? Can you imagine if the entire Grammy telecast ends with M.I.A., Diplo, and Switch up there at the podium? How cool would that be? Also: this is the only Grammy nomination that M.I.A. received. Weird, huh? All in all, Coldplay are up for seven awards, Jay-Z, Ne-Yo, and Kanye are each up for six, Alison Krauss, John Mayer, Robert Plant, Radiohead, and Jazmine Sullivan (hey, there's a party!) are all up for five, and Adele, Danger Mouse, the Eagles, Lupe Fiasco, George Strait, and T.I. each got four noms. Not bad, right? As usual, there are some pretty interesting nominations in the genre categories as well. Daft Punk, Robyn, Moby, Kylie Minogue, Cyndi Lauper, and Brazilian Girls are the noms for Best Electronic/Dance Album, Daft Punk, Hot Chip, and Sam Sparro will duke it out with Madonna, Lady Gaga, and Rihanna for Best Dance Recording, Death Cab for Cutie is up against Radiohead, Coldplay, Springsteen, and Kings of Leon for Best Rock Song, Beck, Death Cab, Gnarls Barkley, My Morning Jacket, and Radiohead are the Alternative noms, while Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, Lupe Fiasco, Nas, and T.I. are up for Best Rap Album. Stephen Colbert and David Sedaris are up for Best Spoken Word Album, Flight of the Conchords got a Best Comedy Album nom, and Jonny Greenwood's There Will Be Blood score is up for Best Score Soundtrack Album. No Age get to fight Metallica for Best Recording Package, while Radiohead and Nine Inch Nails are both nominated for Best Boxed Set or Limited Edition Package. Danger Mouse and Nigel Godrich are up for Producer of the Year, Justice got a Best Remixed Recording nom for their mix of MGMT's "Electric Feel", and Cornelius is up for Best Surround Sound Album. Weezer, Gnarls Barkley, Erykah Badu, and Radiohead are up for Best Short Form Music Video, as is that Jack White and Alicia Keys James Bond song, which is weird, because that video is terrible. The Grammys air on CBS on February 8, 2009. I can't wait to see what M.I.A. wears!</article>

			<article>"Too sexy" for Viva la Vida, but just right to combat AIDS, Coldplay and Kylie Minogue's recent collaboration "Lhuna" is available as of today (aka World AIDS Day) via the (RED) movement's new (RED)WIRE music subscription service/e-zine. Proceeds from the track, laid down by the Aussie siren and the bombastic Brits during the latter's sessions for this year's Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends LP, go to providing medicine for Africans with HIV/AIDS-- so when your girlfriend catches you listening to it later tonight with the lights down, you can pull the old "good cause" card.Speaking of Kylie's encounters with big names, there are plenty to be found on Boombox, her forthcoming remix LP, due January 5 in the UK from Parlophone. The Chemical Brothers, Fischerspooner, Mylo, Riton, and Whitey are among those who turn in remixes on the set, which also includes a Kylie/New Order "bootleg" mashup. Shucks, seems like every big name there is wants a piece of Ms. Minogue these days; NME.com reports that Paris Hilton's second album is, by the socialite's own admission, "very dance, like Kylie Minogue." Fingers crossed for the "Locomotion" cover, eh?Kylie's out on the road a bit this month, with dates in Asia and her native Australia. As for her partners in palpitation Coldplay, they're currently enjoying their victory lap in the wake of the un-sexy but highly successful Viva la Vida.Boombox:01 Can't Get Blue Monday Out of My Head (bootleg with New Order)02 Spinning Around (7th District Club Mental Mix)03 Wow (Death Metal Disco Scene Mix)04 Love at First Sight (Kid Creme Vocal Dub)05 Slow (Chemical Brothers Mix)06 Come Into My World (Fischerspooner Mix)07 Red Blooded Woman (Whitey Mix)08 I Believe in You (Mylo Mix)09 In Your Eyes (Knuckleheadz Mix)10 Hearts (Mark Brown's Pacha Ibiza Upper Terrace Mix)11 On a Night Like This (Bini  Martini Mix)12 Giving You Up (Riton Re-Rub Vocal Mix)13 In My Arms (Sbastien Lger Vocal Mix)14 The One (Britrocka Remix)15 Your Disco Needs You (Casino Mix)16 Boombox (LA Riots Remix)17 Can't Get You Out of My Head (Greg Kurstin 2007 Mix) *18 Butterfly (Mark Picchiotti Sandstorm Dub) ** iTunes bonus trackKylie:12-01 Beijing, China - Workers' Gymnasium12-04 Taipei, Taiwan - Soccer Stadium12-08 Auckland, Australia - Vector Arena12-14 Sydney, Australia - Acer Arena12-19 Melbourne, Australia - Rod Laver ArenaColdplay:12-01 Birmingham, England - NIA12-02 Birmingham, England - NIA12-03 Birmingham, England - NIA12-06 Glasgow, Scotland - SECC12-07 Liverpool, England - Echo Arena12-09 Glasgow, Scotland - SECC12-11 Manchester, England - MEN Arena12-12 Manchester, England - MEN Arena12-14 London, England - O2 Arena12-15 London, England - O2 Arena12-16 London, England - O2 Arena12-19 Belfast, Northern Ireland - Odyssey Arena12-21 Dublin, Ireland - The O212-22 Dublin, Ireland - The O212-23 Belfast, Northern Ireland - Odyssey Arena02-12 Tokyo, Japan - Saitama Super Arena02-14 Osaka, Japan - Kobe World Kinen Hall02-15 Osaka, Japan - Kobe World Kinen Hall02-27 Perth, Australia - Burswood Dome03-03 Melbourne, Australia - Rod Laver Arena03-04 Melbourne, Australia - Rod Laver03-08 Brisbane, Australia - Entertainment Centre03-09 Brisbane, Australia - Entertainment Centre03-11 Sydney, Australia - Acer Arena03-12 Sydney, Australia - Acer Arena09-12 Manchester, England - LCCC *09-16 Glasgow, Scotland - Hampden Park *09-19 London, England - Wembley Stadium ** with Jay-Z</article>

			<article>Some very big artists are banding together to help fight the very big problem that is the AIDS epidemic, and if the tagline sounds familiar, the songs these folks have contributed won't: Coldplay, R.E.M., Bob Dylan, and U2 are among those who have contributed exclusive tracks to (RED)WIRE, a new digital music magazine from Bono's AIDS-combatting (RED) campaign.(RED)WIRE is due to launch December 1, aka World AIDS Day, according to a Billboard.com report. Those who subscribe can look forward to a weekly issue of the e-zine, packed with a previously unreleased song from a "major" artist, a second song from "an artist (RED) aims to showcase" ("minor" artist?), and a "multimedia piece" detailing (RED)'s charitable efforts. And yes, all proceeds from RED(WIRE) subscriptions go directly to the cause.In addition to the aforementioned, the initiative will also introduce exclusive offerings from the Dixie Chicks and John Legend (covering Bob Marley's "Redemption Song"), plus a recording of tourmates Elvis Costello and the Police playing together on the former's TV show, and another Christmas benefit track from the Killers, this one called "Joseph, Better You Than Me" and featuring Elton John and Pet Shops Boys' Neil Tennant. Nice!There's also talk of having artists curate particular issues, with Jay-Z among the prospective participants. And even if your hard drive is too stuffed with porn and anime bootlegs to accommodate any weekly multimedia e-zines, you can always lend a hand to (RED) by going here.</article>

			<headline>Jay-Z to Join Coldplay on Tour</headline>

			<article>What began in a "Beach Chair" will end up in a stadium (three, to be exact). After a couple years of palling around and a couple collaborations, Jay-Z and Coldplay will play a few UK tour dates together next year. The shows don't come until September 2009, but I guess you need to plan that far ahead when you're dealing with dudes this high-profile.Speaking of Jay-Z/Coldplay collaborations, the Jay-Z-enhanced "Lost +" appears on Coldplay's Prospekt's March EP, which is out today (November 24) via Capitol. The EP comes either by itself as a single disc or in a two-disc deluxe edition of Viva La Vida.Coldplay have plenty of tour dates to keep themselves busy, continuing tomorrow (November 25) in Anaheim, California. Jay-Z, on the other hand, is rumored to be one of the performers at Barack Obama's inauguration, along with Beyonc and Leona Lewis. That would be crazy, but we'll believe it when it's officially announced.Coldplay:11-25 Anaheim, CA - Honda Center11-26 Phoenix, AZ - Jobing.com Arena11-29 Sheffield, England - Sheffield Arena12-01 Birmingham, England - NIA12-02 Birmingham, England - NIA12-03 Birmingham, England - NIA12-06 Glasgow, Scotland - SECC12-07 Liverpool, England - Echo Arena12-09 Glasgow, Scotland - SECC12-11 Manchester, England - MEN Arena12-12 Manchester, England - MEN Arena12-14 London, England - O2 Arena12-15 London, England - O2 Arena12-16 London, England - O2 Arena12-19 Belfast, Northern Ireland - Odyssey Arena12-21 Dublin, Ireland - The O212-22 Dublin, Ireland - The O212-23 Belfast, Northern Ireland - Odyssey Arena02-12 Tokyo, Japan - Saitama Super Arena02-14 Osaka, Japan - Kobe World Kinen Hall02-15 Osaka, Japan - Kobe World Kinen Hall02-27 Perth, Australia - Burswood Dome03-03 Melbourne, Australia - Rod Laver Arena03-04 Melbourne, Australia - Rod Laver03-08 Brisbane, Australia - Entertainment Centre03-09 Brisbane, Australia - Entertainment Centre03-11 Sydney, Australia - Acer Arena03-12 Sydney, Australia - Acer Arena09-12 Manchester, England - LCCC *09-16 Glasgow, Scotland - Hampden Park *09-19 London, England - Wembley Stadium ** with Jay-Z</article>

			<article>Poster by Spike PressThe twentieth anniversary edition of the annual Rock for Kids Rock  Roll Charity Auction will take place December 5 at Chicago's Park West, with the aim of raising some coin for the city's homeless and underprivileged youngsters. Over the years, the Rock for Kids auction has raised more than three million dollars for the cause, and they've once again gathered a mighty impressive lot for the auction block this time out.There's plenty of autographed posters, from the likes of Interpol, Public Enemy, TV on the Radio, Spoon, the Decemberists, Feist, Jarvis Cocker, Dinosaur Jr., Andrew Bird, Elvis Costello, M. Ward, Cursive, Gogol Bordello, Tegan and Sara, Diana Ross, Dolly Parton, Velvet Revolver, Ani DiFranco, Lenny Kravitz, and Monty Python's Eric Idle. Hometown heroes Wilco turn in a series of posters from their recent winter residency , signed by the boys in the band (see below). You've got autographed guitars from Carlos Santana, Mark Knopfler, the Eagles, the Hives (which they broke onstage at the Riviera here in Chicago back in February), John Mellencamp, and Sheryl Crow.There's even some signed vinyl from Cat Power, the Psychedelic Furs, Steve Earle, the Rocky Horror Picture Show cast, Melissa Etheridge, and, tucked way in a display made to look like a bed(!), George Michael. What's more, there are signed photos from Brian "Moses" Wilson (pictured just down yonder), the late Heath Ledger, Rob Zombie, Jay Leno, actress Kathy Bates, Charlton Heston and Kim Hunter in Planet of the Apes , and Sally Field. There's even a photo of the Beatles from their last concert signed by photographer Jim Marshall.And then there's the stuff that doesn't quite fit into those neat little categories. There's an autographed chair from the Flight of the Conchords, a ukulele signed by Jon Brion, a bodrhn (Irish drum) scrawled on by the Pogues, and an autographed drumhead courtesy of Ween. Tapes 'n Tapes sign a light box, and there's one of those singing James Brown dolls autographed by the late legend, signed jackets from Gwen Stefani and Henry "The Fonz" Winkler, a dollar bill signed by Bo Diddley, a soccer ball autographed by Rod Stewart, and a purse written on by Patti LaBelle. And, perhaps coolest of all, a suit, worn by Snoop Dogg. Winner, let me be the first to say: check the pockets.There's also cool stuff expected from Barack Obama, the Arcade Fire, Coldplay, Tom Waits, Bruce Springsteen, Yoko Ono, Joanna Newsom, Modest Mouse, the Hold Steady, the Strokes, R.E.M., Stephen Malkmus, the Magnetic Fields, Hot Chip, Vampire Weekend, Rage Against the Machine, Iron and Wine, Kraftwerk, the Breeders, Bloc Party, Ray Davies, X, Broken Social Scene, Rilo Kiley, Justice, Eddie Vedder, and many others. Geez, Obama! Best get on that.Even if you can't make it to Chicago in person, you can bid by proxy online . Do it for the kids!Here's a sampling of some more Rock for Kids auction material:The PoguesPublic EnemyFlight of the ConchordsCat PowerGeorge Michael</article>

			<headline>Coldplay, Weezer, M.I.A. Sell LPs in New Media Format</headline>
			<newsdate>October 15, 2008 at 04:57 p.m.</newsdate>
			<link>http://pitchfork.com/news/33756-coldplay-weezer-mia-sell-lps-in-new-media-format/</link>
			<article>The world's four biggest music corporations-- Universal, Warner, EMI, and Sony BMG (soon to be Sony Music Entertainment Inc.)-- have teamed with MP3 player and memory card manufacturer SanDisk to create a new music media format called slotMusic.Here's how slotMusic works: These memory cards-- which come pre-loaded with albums in DRM-free MP3 format along with liner notes, album art, videos, and other content-- plug right into phones, portable media devices, computers, and even a few car stereos (with aims at more). Each card sells for about the price of a CD and also comes with a USB adapter to ensure the easy transfer of content from the card to a computer or portable MP3 player.The initial run of slotMusic cards is now shipping and includes entries from Coldplay, Weezer, M.I.A., Young Jeezy, Usher, Rihanna, Ne-Yo, Katy Perry, ABBA, Jimi Hendrix, Elvis Presley, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Keane, among others.But here's the rub: Other than the fact that they're playable on cell phones, these cards don't seem all that different from CDs. They're smaller, but they still come with one album per physical artifact, implying you'd need some sort of carrying case if you wanted to switch between Kala, Skynyrd's Greatest Hits, and One of the Boys (just me?) on the train ride to work. A smaller physical format with limited capacity is still a physical format with limited capacity! Not to mention the fact that plenty of cell phones already come with the capabilities to download music.Maybe the glaring holes in this plan to revolutionize the way people consume music are why the slotMusic press release ends with a blatant admission that it "contains certain forward-looking statements" that "involve numerous risks and uncertainties." Risks and uncertainties such as this one: "Market demand for our products may grow more slowly than our expectations, or there may be a slower adoption rate for these products in new markets that we are targeting."slotMusic: This is gonna change everything. Or nothing.</article>

			<headline>Coldplay Add Jay-Z to "Lost!", Announce EP Details</headline>

			<article>Chris Martin of Coldplay writes-- seriously, longhand-- on his band's webpage that a new version of "Lost!", from Coldplay's recent Viva La Vida LP, is due in the coming weeks, featuring a guest appearance from their pal Jay-Z. [Via Stereogum]The track, titled "Lost +", will appear on a new four-song digital "Lost!" EP, due November 10 the world over on Parlophone/Capitol. Let's just hope this goes a little better than "Beach Chair".And then there's Prospekt's March, an EP featuring recently finished tunes from the Viva la Vida sessions that Martin notes "might be considered too catchy or too heavy for Coldplay songs but in our minds... complete the Viva La Vida picture." The EP will be issued digitally, physically, and in a special edition of Viva La Vida. It will sport the Jigga-assisted "Lost +", and you can get a small taste of the tune "Glass of Water" via this live performance video clip. Prospekt's March is due in November.When these two musical juggernauts found the time for a meet-and-greet is unclear; Coldplay's been pushing Viva la Vida hard through the summer, and Jay's been starting a new label, working up The Blueprint III and rocking shows for Barack Obama. Both have dates on the way.Prospekt's March EP:01 Life in Technicolor II02 Postcards From Far Away03 Glass of Water04 Rainy Day05 Prospekt's March / Poppyfields06 Lost + (ft.

			<headline>R.E.M., Nirvana, Coldplay, Interpol on New Guitar Hero</headline>

			<article>Hope you like Tool, 'cuz this thing's a veritable Home Depot (zing!). The full setlist for Guitar Hero World Tour, the fourth major installment in the carpal-tunnel-inducing joyride, has been announced, and it's a doozy. (Though not as much of a doozy as a certain competitor.-- Ed) 86 tracks-- master recordings, all-- will come with your copy of GHWT when it's released by Activision October 26.Notable bands on the list include Dinosaur Jr., Interpol, Beastie Boys, Coldplay, Nirvana, Muse, Oasis, Modest Mouse, Interpol, the Mars Volta, Blondie, the Sex Pistols, At the Drive-In, R.E.M., and, yes, Tool. Lots of Tool. The part of us that checks out at 5 p.m. sure is stoked for the chance to play through Paramore's awesome "Misery Business".But what about that new Smashing Pumpkins song "G.L.O.W." they're debuting through the game? You've gotta pay extra for it. The only Pumpkins song that's pre-loaded is "Today"; "G.L.O.W." will be available in a three-song expansion pack that also gets you "1979" and "The Everlasting Gaze". "Wordz Iz Cheap"; exclusive content, less so. Billy Corgan appears as a character in the game, as do Ted Nugent and Zakk Wylde.World Tour is the first in the Guitar Hero series to feature not just a plastic guitar, but a drumset and microphone. (Just like that other game.) You can also battle other players live over the internet, as well as write and record your own music.Guitar Hero World Tour setlist, alphabetically:311: "Beautiful Disaster"30 Seconds To Mars: "The Kill"Airbourne: "Too Much Too Young"The Allman Brothers Band: "Ramblin' Man"Anouk: "Good God"The Answer: "Never Too Late"At The Drive-In: "One Armed Scissor"Beastie Boys: "No Sleep Till Brooklyn"Beatsteaks: "Hail to the Freaks"Billy Idol: "Rebel Yell"Black Label Society: "Stillborn"Black Rebel Motorcycle Club: "Weapon of Choice"blink-182: "Dammit"Blondie: "One Way or Another"Bob Seger  The Silver Bullet Band: "Hollywood Nights"Bon Jovi: "Livin' on a Prayer"Bullet For My Valentine: "Scream Aim Fire"Coldplay: "Shiver"Creedence Clearwater Revival: "Up Around the Bend"The Cult: "Love Removal Machine"Dinosaur Jr.: "Feel the Pain"The Doors: "Love Me Two Times"Dream Theater: "Pull Me Under"The Eagles: "Hotel California"The Enemy: "Aggro"Filter: "Hey Man, Nice Shot"Fleetwood Mac: "Go Your Own Way"Foo Fighters: "Everlong"The Guess Who: "American Woman"Hush Puppies: "You're Gonna Say Yeah!"Interpol: "Obstacle 1"Jane's Addiction: "Mountain Song"Jimi Hendrix: "Purple Haze (Live)"Jimi Hendrix: "The Wind Cries Mary"Jimmy Eat World: "The Middle"Joe Satriani: "Satch Boogie"Kent: "Vinternoll2"KoRn: "Freak on a Leash"Lacuna Coil: "Our Truth"Lenny Kravitz: "Are You Gonna Go My Way"Linkin Park: "What I've Done"The Living End: "Prisoner of Society"Los Lobos: "La Bamba"Lost Prophets: "Rooftops (A Liberation Broadcast)"Lynyrd Skynyrd: "Sweet Home Alabama (Live)"Mars Volta: "L'Via L'Viaquez"MC5's Wayne Kramer: "Kick out the Jams"Metallica: "Trapped Under Ice"Michael Jackson: "Beat It"Modest Mouse: "Float On"Motrhead: "Overkill"Muse: "Assassin"Negramaro: "Nuvole e Lenzuola"Nirvana: "About a Girl (Unplugged)"No Doubt: "Spiderwebs"NOFX: "Soul Doubt"Oasis: "Some Might Say"Ozzy Osbourne: "Crazy Train"Ozzy Osbourne: "Mr. Crowley"Paramore: "Misery Business"Pat Benatar: "Heartbreaker"R.E.M.: "The One I Love"Radio Futura: "Escuela De Calor"Rise Against: "Re-Education Through Labor"Sex Pistols: "Pretty Vacant"Silversun Pickups: "Lazy Eye"Smashing Pumpkins: "Today"Steely Dan: "Do It Again"Steve Miller Band: "The Joker"Sting: "Demolition Man (Live)"The Stone Roses: "Love Spreads"Stuck in the Sound: "Toy Boy"Sublime: "Santeria"Survivor: "Eye of the Tiger"System of a Down: "B.Y.O.B."Ted Nugent: "Stranglehold"Ted Nugent's Original Guitar Duel RecordingTokio Hotel: "Monsoon"Tool: "Parabola"Tool: "Schism"Tool: "Vicarious"Trust: "Antisocial"Van Halen: "Hot for Teacher"Willie Nelson: "On the Road Again"Wings: "Band on the Run"Zakk Wylde's Original Guitar Duel Recording</article>
