			<description>"Clocks" won the 2004 Grammy Award for Record Of The Year. A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD won the 2003 Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. "In My Place" won the 2003 Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal. In 2000, Coldplay appeared seemingly out of nowhere and immediately advanced to the head of the Britpop class in the UK, while easily outdistancing the likes of Oasis and Blur in terms of US popularity. The most striking thing was that they did it with zero attitude and unassuming, melodic tunes humbly presented with a minimum of fuss and a maximum of memorability. That trend continues on the band's second album, A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD. There's little stylistic alteration from PARACHUTES here, which is just fine, considering how enormously and instantly appealing that style is. While Travis, Elbow, and other entrants in the Britpop sweepstakes offer a not dissimilar sound, none can communicate with the honest immediacy and directness of Coldplay....FullDescription</description>

			<description>Although Coldplay was already big before A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD's 2002 release, nothing could have prepared the British band for the album's Grammy-garnering runaway success. In addition to becoming a full-blown rock star, frontman Chris Martin remained in the media spotlight through his marriage to actress Gwyneth Paltrow and the subsequent birth of the couple's child. What followed for Coldplay was, reportedly, a difficult and lengthy recording process where the group tinkered extensively with their signature sound and eventually arrived back at square one. "Square One" is, in fact, where X instead they take their time establishing a resonant, anthemic atmosphere, most notably on the slowly building "Fix You." It's clear on X...FullDescription</description>

			<description>Includes a bonus DVD of a live concert, lyrics links, and a tour diary documentary. One of the few post-Radiohead Britpop bands to achieve chart-topping success in America, Coldplay follows up its lauded second outing, A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD, with this live release. Drawing largely from the aforementioned album, LIVE 2003 features frontman Chris Martin at his charismatic best, whether he's rocking out on the hard-charging opener "Politik," crooning over an acoustic guitar on "See You Soon," or manning the piano on the majestic surge of "Clocks." Martin and the lads mix things up a bit by adding atmospheric introductions to some tunes, whether it's the woozy guitar twang before "A Rush of Blood to the Head" or the dreamy keyboards prior to the supremely catchy hit "Yellow." The live set also includes two non-album originals-"One I Love" and "Moses." LIVE 2003 is a document of an earnest but entirely unpretentious rock band at the peak of its powers....FullDescription</description>

			<description>As if 2002 wasn't monumental enough for Coldplay with the success of their second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head, 2003 was equally amazing thanks to singles like "The Scientist" and "Clocks" and the band's live CD/DVD set. To continue on in its classic modest fashion, the band released the God Put a Smile Upon Your Face EP just weeks after Live 2003. Coldplay enthusiasts should be pleased with this British import of B-sides and rarities, but for total completists, this EP matches the Japanese version of Clocks with the exception of the title track. If "God Put a Smile Upon Your Face" hasn't been on repeat play already, listening to this little gem is worthy enough to merit such an effort. Other highlights include the juicy pop number "Crests of Waves" and the haunting live version of "Yellow," which was specially recorded in December 2001 and broadcast on KCRW's Morning Becomes Eclectic. "Murder" and "Animals" are traditional Coldplay tracks, for they combine the lilting sentiments of Parachutes and the raw conscience of A Rush of Blood to the Head. Another standout release from the London foursome. [Videos for "Clocks" and "In My Place" are also included.] ~ MacKenzie Wilson2007 reissue of this extremely limited enhanced Asian-only eight track EP. Originally issued in 2003, 'God Put A Smile Upon Your Face' is taken from their hot-selling A Rush Of Blood To The Head album. This EP also includes seven additional cuts including five non-album audio tracks ('Crests Of Waves', 'Animals', 'Murder', 'In My Place' Live In Manchester and 'Yellow' Live On KCRW) plus two enhanced videos: 'Clocks' and 'In My Place'.

			<description>Zach Braff, cast member of the quirky TV sitcom SCRUBS, follows his show's lead by using eclectic music for the soundtrack to his film GARDEN STATE. The writer, director, and star of this acclaimed movie, Braff also served as the executive music producer, compiling an excellent mix of contemporary indie-rock, with a few older selections added for good measure. For this tale of an estranged son returning to his New Jersey hometown for his mother's funeral, Braff taps the gamut of emotions appropriate to such an awkward homecoming. There's the twee pop-rock of the Shins ("Caring Is Creepy") and the melancholy musings of Coldplay ("Don't Panic"), along with the burnished regret of Men at Work's Colin Hay ("I Just Don't Think I'll Ever Get Over You") and Bonnie Somerville's wistfully nostalgic "Winding Road." Equally effective are Braff's soft electronica choices, ranging from Zero 7's ethereal and rich "In the Waiting Line" to Thievery Corporation's exotic, Middle Eastern-flavored "Lebanese Blonde." Also featuring the spare, acoustic sounds of Iron ...FullDescription</description>

			<description>Turning the covers album concept on its head, Rhythms del Mundo: Cuba doesn't set a varied group of northern artists loose on the music made famous by the Buena Vista Social Club, but instead sets the Club's members lose on the northerners' own songs. Now that's an inspired idea, and all to aid charities assisting the victims of natural disasters and raising awareness of climate change. However, to call this a covers album is a bit misleading, as most of the songs feature the original vocals, and occasionally some of the original instrumentation, but it's not a remix project either, as the Social Club add their own music to the original recordings. So, it's a grand fusion of Cuban and northern sounds. And eclectic to boot, with songs contributed by such international artists as Quincy Jones, Sting and U2, as well as the likes of Radiohead and Coldplay. But to give the set a real frisson, the Social Club also took on such younger, feted artists as Franz Ferdinand, Maroon 5, the Kaiser Chiefs, and the so hot they're actually sizzling Arctic Monkeys....FullDescription</description>

			<description>This 16-track collection draws from the considerable pool of artists who won Grammy awards in the rock category between 1989 and 2005. In addition to soaring anthems (see Stone Temple Pilots' neo-grunge hit "Plush" and Coldplay's pensive single "In My Place"), the compilation features songs not typically considered "rock," including the Chemical Brothers' techno-funk track "Block Rockin' Beats" and Fiona Apple's soulful "Criminal," making this Grammy set an intriguing and surprisingly eclectic mix.Author: Quincy Jones.</description>

			<description>The inexplicable omissions of Kanye West, Gwen Stefani, and Black Eyed Peas notwithstanding (all of whom had very successful years in 2005), 2006 GRAMMY NOMINEES is an even-handed overview of the state of popular music for the year in question. The Gorillaz's "Feel Good Inc." kicks off the set, and establishes a good-times tone with its rubbery bass groove, Brit-pop inflections, and cameo by De La Soul. Dance pop from Mariah Carey is offered alongside rock from Green Day and the Foo Fighters, while Neil Young and the Rolling Stones represent the contingent of dinosaur rockers still going strong in the early '00s. The pleasantly surprising inclusion of indie rock bands Death Cab for Cutie and Franz Ferdinand round out this eclectic set.</description>

			<description>With Until Now, house music supergroup Swedish House Mafia (Axwell, Steve Angello, and Sebastian Ingrosso) offer their second compilation of productions, remixes, and favored tracks, following the blueprint of their 2010 set Until One. The bad news is that the album coincides with the group's splitting up and farewell tour, but the good news is that the dancefloor fillers are bigger and more powerful this time out, starting right with the group's own opener, "Greyhound," which combines a Gary Numan-esque new wave bassline with pure post-trance bliss. It's a keeper, as is their "kick this party up/start a riot" anthem with Knife Party called "Antidote," while their Tinie Tempah team-up "Miami 2 Ibiza" also goes back to the '80s and puts some Kraftwerk-like robot beats behind the U.K. rapper's double-time swagger. It's hard not to put hands in the air once Coldplay and the trio team up for an increasingly uplifting remix of "Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall," and with vocalist and frequent Swedish House Mafia collaborator John Martin bringing the power ballad to the club with the sweaty and gutsy floor-filler "Don't You Worry Child," Until One is easily topped by this swan song. Still, there's little here that suggests Swedish House Mafia is more than the sum of its parts, and as Axwell, Angello, and Ingrosso split into three equally powered powerhouses, it seems this supergroup was more a fun lark than a focused project. Still, it's as fun as larks come, and for the legions of fans they picked up while spinning the Miami to Ibiza circuit, it's a welcome souvenir. ~ David JeffriesPhotographer: Fredrik Skogkvist.</description>
